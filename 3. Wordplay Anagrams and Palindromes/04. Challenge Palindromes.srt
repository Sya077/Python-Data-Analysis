00:00:00,01 --> 00:00:05,06
(bright electronic music)

2
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:07,01
- [Instructor] For your challenge,

3
00:00:07,01 --> 00:00:09,05
you should extend the anagram machinery

4
00:00:09,05 --> 00:00:13,08
that we built together to find all palindromic pairs

5
00:00:13,08 --> 00:00:16,05
of words in the English language,

6
00:00:16,05 --> 00:00:18,08
or at least, in our dictionary.

7
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:21,04
That is, you should find pairs of words

8
00:00:21,04 --> 00:00:24,00
that become each other when we reverse

9
00:00:24,00 --> 00:00:25,09
the order of their letters.

10
00:00:25,09 --> 00:00:29,05
For instance, reward and drawer.

11
00:00:29,05 --> 00:00:33,08
That will also include true palindromes, such as radar,

12
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:37,03
where the reverse of the word is the word itself.

13
00:00:37,03 --> 00:00:41,01
I'll give you a hint, to reverse a string,

14
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:42,02
go back to what we learned

15
00:00:42,02 --> 00:00:45,08
about slicing sequences in Python.

16
00:00:45,08 --> 00:00:49,00
This challenge should take you 10 minutes.
