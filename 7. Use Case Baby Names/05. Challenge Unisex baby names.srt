00:00:00,03 --> 00:00:05,06
(playful music)

2
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:07,00
- [Narrator] For your challenge,

3
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:10,05
I would like you to find a top ten unisex names

4
00:00:10,05 --> 00:00:13,01
and to plot their popularity throughout the years

5
00:00:13,01 --> 00:00:17,07
for both the male and female usage of the name.

6
00:00:17,07 --> 00:00:20,08
We will define unisex names as those for which

7
00:00:20,08 --> 00:00:23,08
the total number of boys and a total number of girls

8
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:28,06
born across all years and within a factor of two.

9
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:29,08
That means that you're going to compute

10
00:00:29,08 --> 00:00:31,02
the total number of boys,

11
00:00:31,02 --> 00:00:33,06
divide by the total number of girls,

12
00:00:33,06 --> 00:00:37,05
and verify that that's between 0.5 and two.

13
00:00:37,05 --> 00:00:41,05
Given the technical nature of some Pandas computations,

14
00:00:41,05 --> 00:00:43,03
I have some hints for you.

15
00:00:43,03 --> 00:00:46,07
Try using DataFrame.groupby().

16
00:00:46,07 --> 00:00:48,05
Take advantage of the fact that Pandas

17
00:00:48,05 --> 00:00:52,07
can execute a mathematical operation between two series

18
00:00:52,07 --> 00:00:55,04
even if they have different indexes.

19
00:00:55,04 --> 00:00:58,08
And finally, if you need to drop not a number,

20
00:00:58,08 --> 00:01:03,00
nan values, use DataFrame.dropna.
