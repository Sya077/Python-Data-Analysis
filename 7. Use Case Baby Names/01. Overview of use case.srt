00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,05
- [Instructor] We are now going to apply pandas

2
00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:06,04
to an intriguing real world use case.

3
00:00:06,04 --> 00:00:11,04
We will analyze the U.S. Social Security Baby Name Catalog,

4
00:00:11,04 --> 00:00:15,04
which reports the names given to male and female newborns

5
00:00:15,04 --> 00:00:18,03
for every year since 1880.

6
00:00:18,03 --> 00:00:20,02
This is a very simple data set,

7
00:00:20,02 --> 00:00:22,04
but it's great fun to play with,

8
00:00:22,04 --> 00:00:25,08
and it has been mined, analyzed, and visualized

9
00:00:25,08 --> 00:00:29,00
in many publications and websites.

10
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:31,06
Specifically, I will show you how to load it,

11
00:00:31,06 --> 00:00:35,06
how to track the popularity of a name across all years,

12
00:00:35,06 --> 00:00:39,07
and how to extract the 10 most popular names every year.

13
00:00:39,07 --> 00:00:41,02
Your challenge will be about finding

14
00:00:41,02 --> 00:00:44,00
the most common unisex names.
