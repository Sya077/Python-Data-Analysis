00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,07
- [Instructor] In this chapter,

2
00:00:01,07 --> 00:00:03,07
we are going to experiment with NumPy

3
00:00:03,07 --> 00:00:06,02
on a real world use case,

4
00:00:06,02 --> 00:00:08,06
analyzing weather data from NOAA,

5
00:00:08,06 --> 00:00:12,05
the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration.

6
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:18,07
The GHCN, the Global Historical Climatology Network Daily

7
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:22,02
is an integrated database of daily climate summary

8
00:00:22,02 --> 00:00:26,07
from land surface stations across the globe.

9
00:00:26,07 --> 00:00:29,06
Many in big cities for instance.

10
00:00:29,06 --> 00:00:31,04
Climate summaries, in this case,

11
00:00:31,04 --> 00:00:33,00
means variables

12
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:35,08
such as the minimum and maximum temperatures,

13
00:00:35,08 --> 00:00:39,02
the total precipitation, and so on.

14
00:00:39,02 --> 00:00:41,03
The data files that we will be using

15
00:00:41,03 --> 00:00:44,05
can be obtained from the NOAA website.

16
00:00:44,05 --> 00:00:47,03
Together we will download a station list

17
00:00:47,03 --> 00:00:51,01
and use it to locate temperature data for cities.

18
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:54,07
We will load the data files, fill missing values,

19
00:00:54,07 --> 00:00:56,08
and smooth time series.

20
00:00:56,08 --> 00:00:57,07
Finally,

21
00:00:57,07 --> 00:01:00,04
we will create a visualization of daily temperatures

22
00:01:00,04 --> 00:01:04,00
inspired by the New York Times weather plots.
