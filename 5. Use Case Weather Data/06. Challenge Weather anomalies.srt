1
00:00:00,02 --> 00:00:05,06
(upbeat chime)

2
00:00:05,06 --> 00:00:06,09
- For your challenge,

3
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:10,06
I'm asking you to plot the temperature anomaly for New York

4
00:00:10,06 --> 00:00:14,01
by computing yearly temperature averages for each year

5
00:00:14,01 --> 00:00:16,09
and comparing those with a mid-century average

6
00:00:16,09 --> 00:00:21,06
in the 1945-1955 decade.

7
00:00:21,06 --> 00:00:23,03
You can make yearly averages

8
00:00:23,03 --> 00:00:25,01
just as we did for the title

9
00:00:25,01 --> 00:00:26,03
of the New York Times inspired plot.

10
00:00:26,03 --> 00:00:29,09
TMIN plus TMAX over two

11
00:00:29,09 --> 00:00:32,03
averaged across the year.

12
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:34,05
To make the mid-century average,

13
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:40,00
just sum up results for 1945 through 1955

14
00:00:40,00 --> 00:00:42,06
and then take the difference.

15
00:00:42,06 --> 00:00:46,00
This challenge should take about 15 minutes.
