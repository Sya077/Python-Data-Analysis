00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,01
- [Instructor] For most of the videos in this course,

2
00:00:03,01 --> 00:00:05,08
we will be working through one of the Jupyter Notebooks

3
00:00:05,08 --> 00:00:07,06
that I prepare for you.

4
00:00:07,06 --> 00:00:10,01
For each notebook, we will go through the path

5
00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:12,04
and code that it contains.

6
00:00:12,04 --> 00:00:14,04
We will discuss what the code does

7
00:00:14,04 --> 00:00:16,02
and why I wrote it that way.

8
00:00:16,02 --> 00:00:20,04
We will execute it and examine the resulting output.

9
00:00:20,04 --> 00:00:23,05
At any time, you're welcome to pause the video,

10
00:00:23,05 --> 00:00:26,00
inspect the code, make changes

11
00:00:26,00 --> 00:00:28,06
and run your own experiments.

12
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:32,02
All the notebooks are collected in your exercise files,

13
00:00:32,02 --> 00:00:35,00
organized by course chapter.

14
00:00:35,00 --> 00:00:40,09
They are the files with .ipynb file ending.

15
00:00:40,09 --> 00:00:43,05
You will also see some of the data files

16
00:00:43,05 --> 00:00:46,02
that we will be analyzing.

17
00:00:46,02 --> 00:00:49,09
In Chapter Five, I have included a subfolder

18
00:00:49,09 --> 00:00:52,03
named Downloaded.

19
00:00:52,03 --> 00:00:54,04
These are files that we will download

20
00:00:54,04 --> 00:00:57,00
from the web using Python,

21
00:00:57,00 --> 00:00:58,07
but I am including them here

22
00:00:58,07 --> 00:01:02,07
in case something goes wrong with the download.

23
00:01:02,07 --> 00:01:04,07
We open a notebook by finding it

24
00:01:04,07 --> 00:01:08,07
within the Jupyter Notebook file browser

25
00:01:08,07 --> 00:01:11,01
and clicking on it.

26
00:01:11,01 --> 00:01:14,04
The notebook cell that we're discussing and running

27
00:01:14,04 --> 00:01:18,05
will always be the one enclosed by a blue or green box.

28
00:01:18,05 --> 00:01:20,02
Once we're done with the notebook,

29
00:01:20,02 --> 00:01:24,06
you can close the browser tab

30
00:01:24,06 --> 00:01:28,05
and shut down the notebook in the Jupyter file browser

31
00:01:28,05 --> 00:01:32,00
by clicking on the box and then clicking Shutdown.
