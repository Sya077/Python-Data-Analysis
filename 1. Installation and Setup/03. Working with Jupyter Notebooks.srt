00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:01,09
- [Narrator] Jupyter notebooks,

2
00:00:01,09 --> 00:00:04,06
offer a very convenient way to write code,

3
00:00:04,06 --> 00:00:07,08
run it, and collect the results including plots,

4
00:00:07,08 --> 00:00:10,01
in a single document.

5
00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:13,05
You can even write formatted text and equations.

6
00:00:13,05 --> 00:00:15,08
This is my favorite way of using Python,

7
00:00:15,08 --> 00:00:18,05
because it lets me experiment with data and code,

8
00:00:18,05 --> 00:00:21,05
document my work, and go back to it later.

9
00:00:21,05 --> 00:00:24,09
You start Jupiter notebook from the Anaconda navigator,

10
00:00:24,09 --> 00:00:26,05
by clicking on launch.

11
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:28,06
If you don't have an Anaconda,

12
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:35,03
you can go to a terminal, and type Jupyter notebook.

13
00:00:35,03 --> 00:00:37,06
A web browser opens, and I can choose

14
00:00:37,06 --> 00:00:40,09
if I wish to load an existing notebook from the file system,

15
00:00:40,09 --> 00:00:42,07
or to start a new one,

16
00:00:42,07 --> 00:00:46,02
which I do at the top right of the screen.

17
00:00:46,02 --> 00:00:49,02
New, Python three notebook.

18
00:00:49,02 --> 00:00:52,09
Here's the notebook. See the green box at the top?.

19
00:00:52,09 --> 00:00:58,07
It's a cell. It's ready for me to write some Python,

20
00:00:58,07 --> 00:01:00,02
for instance,

21
00:01:00,02 --> 00:01:01,00
(keyboard typing)

22
00:01:01,00 --> 00:01:03,00
The customary equating.

23
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:07,07
I execute the code, by pressing Shift + Enter,

24
00:01:07,07 --> 00:01:11,06
or Shift + return depending on your keyboard.

25
00:01:11,06 --> 00:01:15,02
The output is printed immediately below it.

26
00:01:15,02 --> 00:01:19,02
I can click inside the cell,

27
00:01:19,02 --> 00:01:23,03
modify it,

28
00:01:23,03 --> 00:01:27,08
and execute it again, with shift enter.

29
00:01:27,08 --> 00:01:30,00
If a cell has a blue border,

30
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:34,03
I need to press ENTER before I can edit it.

31
00:01:34,03 --> 00:01:39,09
Or I can click inside a different cell, to edit that one.

32
00:01:39,09 --> 00:01:41,07
In addition to a simple command,

33
00:01:41,07 --> 00:01:47,09
I can write a function over multiple lines.

34
00:01:47,09 --> 00:01:50,07
The editor, will color the Python source keywords,

35
00:01:50,07 --> 00:01:53,09
appropriately.

36
00:01:53,09 --> 00:01:58,06
Again, I execute with Shift + Enter

37
00:01:58,06 --> 00:02:03,00
cells, can also contain text rather than code.

38
00:02:03,00 --> 00:02:06,02
For that, I can use the drop down menu cell,

39
00:02:06,02 --> 00:02:10,06
to change the cell type to markdown.

40
00:02:10,06 --> 00:02:13,04
Then I click in the cell and start writing.

41
00:02:13,04 --> 00:02:16,06
Markdown is a simple but powerful text format

42
00:02:16,06 --> 00:02:20,04
that can do basic formatting, bold, italic,

43
00:02:20,04 --> 00:02:25,04
bullet points, hyperlinks, and even mathematical formulas.

44
00:02:25,04 --> 00:02:31,01
For instance, bold, (keyboard typing), with two asterisks.

45
00:02:31,01 --> 00:02:33,08
(keyboard typing)

46
00:02:33,08 --> 00:02:37,09
URLs, which are recognized,

47
00:02:37,09 --> 00:02:40,04
(keyboard typing)

48
00:02:40,04 --> 00:02:42,02
a bullet point,

49
00:02:42,02 --> 00:02:48,01
and a formula in the LaTeX language, between dollar signs.

50
00:02:48,01 --> 00:02:50,06
When I execute the cell, with shift Enter,

51
00:02:50,06 --> 00:02:54,02
everything is formatted in prettified.

52
00:02:54,02 --> 00:02:57,02
To copy a cell, I can click inside it,

53
00:02:57,02 --> 00:03:01,03
or use the arrow keys to select it, and then press

54
00:03:01,03 --> 00:03:07,00
escape C, to copy and then escape V, to paste.

55
00:03:07,00 --> 00:03:11,01
To cut a cell, I can do escape X

56
00:03:11,01 --> 00:03:19,02
To delete a cell ctrl M, and then D, and again D,

57
00:03:19,02 --> 00:03:20,02
Jupyter wants to be sure

58
00:03:20,02 --> 00:03:22,09
you really want to delete that cell.

59
00:03:22,09 --> 00:03:26,06
Or you can use the menus, of course,

60
00:03:26,06 --> 00:03:29,05
I gave you only the most useful keyboard shortcuts,

61
00:03:29,05 --> 00:03:36,00
but there are many more, look under the Help menu.

62
00:03:36,00 --> 00:03:39,00
The notebook is saved periodically for us,

63
00:03:39,00 --> 00:03:43,01
but I can also do that at any time with command S,

64
00:03:43,01 --> 00:03:46,09
ah, and I can give this notebook a name,

65
00:03:46,09 --> 00:03:50,09
such as learning Jupyter,

66
00:03:50,09 --> 00:03:54,07
by clicking at the top of the window.

67
00:03:54,07 --> 00:03:57,02
Go find the Jupyter notebook documentation,

68
00:03:57,02 --> 00:03:59,07
at Jupiter.org.

69
00:03:59,07 --> 00:04:01,09
You will also learn about Jupyter lab,

70
00:04:01,09 --> 00:04:03,01
and even more powerful,

71
00:04:03,01 --> 00:04:06,05
and complete interface than notebooks.

72
00:04:06,05 --> 00:04:11,00
For this course however, we will stay with Jupyter notebook.
