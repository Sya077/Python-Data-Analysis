00:00:00,06 --> 00:00:01,07
- [Narrator] For this course,

2
00:00:01,07 --> 00:00:04,05
we need an up to date installation of python three.

3
00:00:04,05 --> 00:00:06,09
And a few third party packages.

4
00:00:06,09 --> 00:00:10,01
Including jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas,

5
00:00:10,01 --> 00:00:12,05
and matplotlib.

6
00:00:12,05 --> 00:00:15,00
In this video, I show you how to install everything

7
00:00:15,00 --> 00:00:17,02
you need on Windows.

8
00:00:17,02 --> 00:00:20,05
However, you can also experiment with Python in the cloud

9
00:00:20,05 --> 00:00:23,05
from your web browser.

10
00:00:23,05 --> 00:00:27,01
I explain how to do so at the end of this chapter.

11
00:00:27,01 --> 00:00:30,05
If you are already using Python on your machine

12
00:00:30,05 --> 00:00:32,08
and you know how to install extra packages,

13
00:00:32,08 --> 00:00:34,07
you are free to do so.

14
00:00:34,07 --> 00:00:37,05
Otherwise, I suggest you follow me

15
00:00:37,05 --> 00:00:41,04
and install the free Anaconda Python distribution.

16
00:00:41,04 --> 00:00:44,02
Which includes everything that we need.

17
00:00:44,02 --> 00:00:48,03
To install, we go to the anaconda.com website,

18
00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:55,01
we find a download link on the top.

19
00:00:55,01 --> 00:00:57,09
Verify that we have the right platform.

20
00:00:57,09 --> 00:01:01,07
And then download the 64 bit graphical installer.

21
00:01:01,07 --> 00:01:04,00
This is currently at version 3.7,

22
00:01:04,00 --> 00:01:08,09
but any later version will also work fine.

23
00:01:08,09 --> 00:01:10,09
Once the download has completed,

24
00:01:10,09 --> 00:01:17,01
we click on installer and proceed through an installation.

25
00:01:17,01 --> 00:01:19,06
This requires a few clicks.

26
00:01:19,06 --> 00:01:27,03
(mouse clicks)

27
00:01:27,03 --> 00:01:31,09
As of January 2020, Python two is no longer supported.

28
00:01:31,09 --> 00:01:34,03
So you should definitely be using version three.

29
00:01:34,03 --> 00:01:37,02
Which is mature, efficient, and introduces

30
00:01:37,02 --> 00:01:42,03
many exciting new features compared to version two.

31
00:01:42,03 --> 00:01:52,02
The final phase of the installation takes a few minutes.

32
00:01:52,02 --> 00:01:54,03
It looks like the setup is finished,

33
00:01:54,03 --> 00:01:57,04
and we now can get started with Python.

34
00:01:57,04 --> 00:02:00,03
We can now try out our new Python

35
00:02:00,03 --> 00:02:04,06
by opening up the Anaconda prompt,

36
00:02:04,06 --> 00:02:07,07
and typing python.

37
00:02:07,07 --> 00:02:10,06
This gets us into the standard python shell,

38
00:02:10,06 --> 00:02:13,08
where we can write and execute code interactively.

39
00:02:13,08 --> 00:02:16,03
The prompt, informs us that this is indeed

40
00:02:16,03 --> 00:02:20,06
the Anaconda version of Python 3.7

41
00:02:20,06 --> 00:02:26,00
It's traditional to say hello.

42
00:02:26,00 --> 00:02:29,05
We can also verify that all the packages that we need

43
00:02:29,05 --> 00:02:34,05
are already installed by attempt to import them.

44
00:02:34,05 --> 00:02:45,00
Numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.

45
00:02:45,00 --> 00:02:47,09
No news is good news.

46
00:02:47,09 --> 00:02:49,00
All done.

47
00:02:49,00 --> 00:02:52,00
We are now ready to start experimenting with python.
