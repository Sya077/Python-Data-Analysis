00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:02,05
- [Instructor] An exciting, recent development

2
00:00:02,05 --> 00:00:06,02
in the Python ecosystem is that it has become possible

3
00:00:06,02 --> 00:00:09,04
to run notebooks in the cloud using services

4
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:14,05
such as Google Colaboratory and Microsoft Azure Notebooks.

5
00:00:14,05 --> 00:00:19,00
With both, you get a rather functional environment for free.

6
00:00:19,00 --> 00:00:21,02
If you'd like to follow along with this course

7
00:00:21,02 --> 00:00:23,04
using Python in the cloud,

8
00:00:23,04 --> 00:00:26,05
I suggest you use Azure Notebooks.

9
00:00:26,05 --> 00:00:28,06
Let me show you how to.

10
00:00:28,06 --> 00:00:32,03
We start at notebooks.azure.com.

11
00:00:32,03 --> 00:00:35,08
We sign in, which you can do using

12
00:00:35,08 --> 00:00:40,09
an existing Microsoft account or creating one.

13
00:00:40,09 --> 00:00:42,09
You may also be asked to create a user name

14
00:00:42,09 --> 00:00:45,00
for your profile.

15
00:00:45,00 --> 00:00:48,03
In Azure Notebooks, notebooks are organized in projects,

16
00:00:48,03 --> 00:00:51,03
so we create a new one.

17
00:00:51,03 --> 00:00:56,05
I will call it Python data analysis.

18
00:00:56,05 --> 00:00:59,00
The easiest way to get the exercise files

19
00:00:59,00 --> 00:01:02,07
into Microsoft Azure is to upload the zip file

20
00:01:02,07 --> 00:01:05,00
that contains all of them.

21
00:01:05,00 --> 00:01:09,03
The Upload button is here on the top right.

22
00:01:09,03 --> 00:01:19,04
So I go find a file and upload it.

23
00:01:19,04 --> 00:01:25,08
To unzip the archive, I open the Azure terminal.

24
00:01:25,08 --> 00:01:31,08
I type cd library to move into the project directory

25
00:01:31,08 --> 00:01:41,09
and then unzip exercise\ files.zip.

26
00:01:41,09 --> 00:01:44,09
This will take a moment.

27
00:01:44,09 --> 00:01:48,04
Once it's done, we can type exit,

28
00:01:48,04 --> 00:01:52,00
and close this tab.

29
00:01:52,00 --> 00:01:53,08
If I refresh the window,

30
00:01:53,08 --> 00:01:57,07
I see that the exercise files have appeared.

31
00:01:57,07 --> 00:02:00,00
We are now ready for our course.

32
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:04,03
For instance, I can look inside the exercise files

33
00:02:04,03 --> 00:02:10,03
for chapter two and select the first notebook.

34
00:02:10,03 --> 00:02:12,07
Azure Notebooks can be somewhat slow when loading

35
00:02:12,07 --> 00:02:14,09
and writing files, but don't worry.

36
00:02:14,09 --> 00:02:16,06
You'll get there.

37
00:02:16,06 --> 00:02:21,04
Also, as we speak, the default Python on Azure is 3.5,

38
00:02:21,04 --> 00:02:23,05
which is too old for this course.

39
00:02:23,05 --> 00:02:25,07
Hopefully that will change soon.

40
00:02:25,07 --> 00:02:28,08
In the meantime, please remember to switch the kernel

41
00:02:28,08 --> 00:02:32,07
to Python 3.6 after you open each notebook.

42
00:02:32,07 --> 00:02:37,04
You do that from the Kernel menu, go into Change kernel,

43
00:02:37,04 --> 00:02:41,06
and select Python 3.6

44
00:02:41,06 --> 00:02:45,05
There are many options out there to use Python in the cloud.

45
00:02:45,05 --> 00:02:50,00
Please feel free to use the one that works out best for you.
