00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:01,07
- [Instructor] For this course,

2
00:00:01,07 --> 00:00:04,03
we need an up to date installation of Python 3,

3
00:00:04,03 --> 00:00:08,08
and a few third party packages including Jupyter, NumPy,

4
00:00:08,08 --> 00:00:11,07
Pandas, and Matplotlib.

5
00:00:11,07 --> 00:00:14,08
In this video I show you how to install everything you need

6
00:00:14,08 --> 00:00:15,07
on MacOS 10.

7
00:00:15,07 --> 00:00:17,06
If you are a Windows user,

8
00:00:17,06 --> 00:00:20,08
feel free to jump to the next video.

9
00:00:20,08 --> 00:00:24,02
Later I will also show you how to use Python in the cloud

10
00:00:24,02 --> 00:00:26,02
using only your web browser.

11
00:00:26,02 --> 00:00:28,09
If you already use Python on your machine

12
00:00:28,09 --> 00:00:33,03
and you know how to install extra packages, please do so.

13
00:00:33,03 --> 00:00:35,03
Otherwise I suggest you follow me

14
00:00:35,03 --> 00:00:38,05
and install the free Anaconda Python Distribution,

15
00:00:38,05 --> 00:00:41,08
which includes everything that we will need.

16
00:00:41,08 --> 00:00:45,01
To install we go to anaconda.com.

17
00:00:45,01 --> 00:00:49,08
We find the download link at the top.

18
00:00:49,08 --> 00:00:51,08
Scroll down to our platform

19
00:00:51,08 --> 00:00:54,06
and select the Anaconda graphical installer

20
00:00:54,06 --> 00:00:57,08
which is currently at version 3.7.

21
00:00:57,08 --> 00:01:01,08
Any later version will also work fine.

22
00:01:01,08 --> 00:01:05,07
As of January 2020, Python 2 is no longer supported,

23
00:01:05,07 --> 00:01:08,02
so you should definitely be using version three

24
00:01:08,02 --> 00:01:10,01
which is mature, efficient,

25
00:01:10,01 --> 00:01:12,08
and introduces many exciting new features

26
00:01:12,08 --> 00:01:15,08
compared to version two.

27
00:01:15,08 --> 00:01:17,07
Once the download has completed,

28
00:01:17,07 --> 00:01:19,01
we click on the installer

29
00:01:19,01 --> 00:01:21,06
and proceed through a standard installation

30
00:01:21,06 --> 00:01:28,02
which will require several clicks.

31
00:01:28,02 --> 00:01:29,05
We are asked also

32
00:01:29,05 --> 00:01:33,04
whether we wish to install the PyCharm IDE,

33
00:01:33,04 --> 00:01:35,05
which is very complete and powerful.

34
00:01:35,05 --> 00:01:38,01
We will not be using it for this course,

35
00:01:38,01 --> 00:01:42,00
but you can give it a try.

36
00:01:42,00 --> 00:01:44,07
We can trash the installer,

37
00:01:44,07 --> 00:01:47,09
and we can now try out our new python installation,

38
00:01:47,09 --> 00:01:53,01
by opening up a terminal and typing Python.

39
00:01:53,01 --> 00:01:56,02
This gets us into the standard Python shell

40
00:01:56,02 --> 00:02:00,01
where we can write an execute code interactively.

41
00:02:00,01 --> 00:02:01,09
The prompt informs us

42
00:02:01,09 --> 00:02:06,04
that this is indeed the Anaconda version of Python 3.7.

43
00:02:06,04 --> 00:02:11,09
It's traditional to just say hello.

44
00:02:11,09 --> 00:02:14,01
We can also verify that all the packages we need

45
00:02:14,01 --> 00:02:18,06
are already installed by attempting to import them.

46
00:02:18,06 --> 00:02:28,07
NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

47
00:02:28,07 --> 00:02:31,02
No news is good news.

48
00:02:31,02 --> 00:02:32,03
All done.

49
00:02:32,03 --> 00:02:35,00
We are now ready to start experimenting with Python.
