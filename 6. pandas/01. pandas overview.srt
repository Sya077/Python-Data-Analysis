00:00:00,05 --> 00:00:03,02
- [Instructor] Pandas has gained broad acceptance

2
00:00:03,02 --> 00:00:04,04
in the Python community

3
00:00:04,04 --> 00:00:08,02
as the data analysis tool for Python.

4
00:00:08,02 --> 00:00:10,02
As of January 2020,

5
00:00:10,02 --> 00:00:12,08
it should reach version 1.0 very soon,

6
00:00:12,08 --> 00:00:15,09
signaling the stability of its API,

7
00:00:15,09 --> 00:00:18,07
its programming interface.

8
00:00:18,07 --> 00:00:23,00
Pandas is built on top of NumPy so it's very fast.

9
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:26,04
And it extends NumPy in ways that are extremely useful

10
00:00:26,04 --> 00:00:29,02
to data analysis.

11
00:00:29,02 --> 00:00:33,08
For instance it attaches labels to table columns and rows.

12
00:00:33,08 --> 00:00:36,05
It lets us access data using indexes

13
00:00:36,05 --> 00:00:38,08
built from any variable.

14
00:00:38,08 --> 00:00:41,01
It allows us to modify table structure

15
00:00:41,01 --> 00:00:43,06
by adding and dropping columns

16
00:00:43,06 --> 00:00:47,00
and by performing other transformations.

17
00:00:47,00 --> 00:00:50,05
It recognizes many common data formats.

18
00:00:50,05 --> 00:00:54,00
It handles missing data easily.

19
00:00:54,00 --> 00:00:58,03
It implements database operations such as joins

20
00:00:58,03 --> 00:01:01,01
and it can even make plots.

21
00:01:01,01 --> 00:01:02,08
So if you want to do data analysis

22
00:01:02,08 --> 00:01:04,09
or data science with Python,

23
00:01:04,09 --> 00:01:08,00
I really recommend that you learn Pandas.
