1
00:00:00,08 --> 00:00:01,08
- Well done.

2
00:00:01,08 --> 00:00:03,05
Thank you for following along

3
00:00:03,05 --> 00:00:05,08
through some rather challenging material.

4
00:00:05,08 --> 00:00:08,05
You are at the start of your road to mastery.

5
00:00:08,05 --> 00:00:10,09
You can now move on to my more advanced courses

6
00:00:10,09 --> 00:00:13,00
on programming efficiently in Python

7
00:00:13,00 --> 00:00:15,06
and on statistics with Python.

8
00:00:15,06 --> 00:00:17,04
Back to the topic of this course,

9
00:00:17,04 --> 00:00:21,01
here are some resources that can help you learn more.

10
00:00:21,01 --> 00:00:23,08
You can find the answer to any question about Python

11
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:26,09
or about NumPy, Matploylib and pandas

12
00:00:26,09 --> 00:00:29,01
on the official websites.

13
00:00:29,01 --> 00:00:30,08
These packages are also discussed in

14
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:35,01
"Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake Vanderplas,

15
00:00:35,01 --> 00:00:38,08
a very insightful and no-nonsense textbook.

16
00:00:38,08 --> 00:00:40,06
If you get stuck, look for help

17
00:00:40,06 --> 00:00:43,07
in an internet forum such as Stack Overflow.

18
00:00:43,07 --> 00:00:46,01
You'll find that Python has a very helpful

19
00:00:46,01 --> 00:00:48,06
and supportive community.

20
00:00:48,06 --> 00:00:51,01
Many have said that the best thing about Python

21
00:00:51,01 --> 00:00:53,09
is that it's a language that makes you happy.

22
00:00:53,09 --> 00:00:58,00
I agree so have fun and do great things.
